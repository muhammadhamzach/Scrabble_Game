# Scrabble Game in C++
This project was made in C++ using the SFML library implemented in Microsoft Visual Studio as a Data Structures & Algorithm project at NUST 
<l>The code file is named as Scrabble.cpp.  Also the dll files are for SFML Library(though you may still need them to be added to your IDE environment). 
<l>Report is also attached for further details.

## Note
The files (pictures & dll files) must be in the same directory as Scrabble.cpp for the code to work
